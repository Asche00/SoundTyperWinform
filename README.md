# SoundTyperWinform

Quick project made by request for a friend in a few hours.

Will play the configured sound when alpha-numeric keys are pressed.

You can change the window this works in by modifying the "eos" statement. 

Currently, the UI is has had little work done to it since this was intended to hide in the background. Will potentially update in the future with the abiliy to control how many players exist, configurable window name, etc.
